            <p> The Public Health Agency of Sweden advises all those with symptoms, even mild, to avoid social contact in order to avoid infecting others. This applies to both work and private life.</p>
            
            <p>Stay at home if you feel unwell. Wait at least two days after you have recovered before returning to work or school.</p>
            
                <p>Those aged over 70 are advised to limit contact with other people as far as possible for some time ahead. This also applies to those who feel well.</p>
            
                    <p> It is particularly important that those of you providing care for the elderly in nursing homes or medical facilities do not to go to work if you have any symptoms of respiratory infection.</p>
            
                        <p>You should avoid visiting elderly relatives unless absolutely essential, even if you show no signs of infection. Avoid all but essential visits to hospitals and elderly care facilities/nursing homes, and do not visit if you have any symptoms of respiratory infection. </p>
